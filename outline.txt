   DATA UNDERSTANDING
    1. Data Collection
The data collection process is the first step in the analysis of a dataset, and it involves gathering all relevant information from various sources to form a comprehension
2. Initial Data inspection
    * Get an overview of the dataset's size, dimensions, and structure
    *understand the data types(numeric, categorical, text)
3. Descriptive statistics 
    * compute summary statistics for each feature, such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc
4. Data Visualization
    *Create visualizations like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore the distribution and relationships between variables. 
    *identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers. 
5. Handle missing values
6. Data cleaning
    *clean the data by addressing inconsistencies, errors, or outliers
    *ensure that the data is in a format suitable for analysis 
7. Feature Engineering
    *Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model
    *Encode categorical
